## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I implemented tags which I barely used when coding, like article and span.

```css
.two {
  object-fit: fit;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my ability to simply detect the type of tag to implement in my html when I see the design of the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a new property I had difficulty understanding for time in CSS. I also learnt how insert attribution.

```css
.body {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
.section {
  max-width: 320px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my CSS responsive skills alot and flexbox properties. I would love to reinforce my knowledge on flexbox and other related properties.
